## The story behind the project

When my beloved wife got pregnant, the need to move to a bigger house knocked our door.
The proccess of searching for a new place fitting our renting budget and requirements was too stressful.

One month after unsuccessful searches, I had an idea: I could create a tiny web scrapper app that would
go to all my home city's real estate agency websites, collect all their real estate available for renting
and attending our budget and requirements. Then, I would list all those options inside a minimalist HTML page.

Thankfully to this tiny and super specific app, I found my new house, where my little girl was born!
